fsmr -- run a mapreduce on a filesystem hierarchy

This is for running a C mapreduce algorithm where the inputs are every entity 
in a filesystem hierarchy.  It's built using MPI, libdftw[1], and libmrmpi[2].

I love dftw, but I need a way to combine and retrieve output.  dftw is a 
general "map" operation... so one general way to manage output is as a 
"reduce".  That's when I found mrmpi.

Why use dftw and not mrmpi's built-in recursion?  That's an open question.  But 
dftw is specialized for file tree walking, with performance analysis to back it 
up[3].  Also, dftw easily accommodates callbacks on all filesystem entities, 
including directories (it has the same interface as ftw(3)).  This also helps 
implement more robust error handling.

To build libfsmr.so, install libdftw and mrmpi[4] and run `make' here.  See 
examples/du_by_owner.c for a simple example of how to write a map() and 
reduce() and call fsmr; export TEST_ARGS=/some/path and run `make test' in the 
examples directory.
