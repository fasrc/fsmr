love dftw, but need a way to get data out
dftw is a general map operation... one general way to manage output is as a "reduce".

why use dftw and not mrmpi's built-in recursion?
	dftw is specialized for file tree walking, with performance analysis
	dftw allows callbacks on all filesystem entities, including directories, too.
