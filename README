fsmr -- filesystem mapreduce

This is for running a mapreduce where the inputs are every entity in a 
filesystem hierarchy.  It's built using libdftw[1] and libmrmpi[2].

I love dftw, but I need a way to combine and retrieve output.  dftw is a 
general "map" operation... so one general way to manage output is as a 
"reduce".

Why use dftw and not mrmpi's built-in recursion?  dftw is specialized for file 
tree walking, with performance analysis to back it up (though I have not 
compared).  Also, dftw allows callbacks on all filesystem entities, including 
directories, too.
